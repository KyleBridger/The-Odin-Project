# The Odin Project
Started June 9, 2025 - Purpose is to complete the Foundations Course by [The Odin Project](https://github.com/theodinproject) and build on top of the knowledge once I complete it.

My goal is to be able to build projects using frontend and backend technologies without having to rely on AI tools. I want to strengthen my coding knowledge so that I have a strong foundation to build on.

I don't have a specific long term goal in doing this project. I am interested in getting into more development now that I have professional experience in IT infrastructure with cloud computing.
